<li> Further improved my responsive design skills </li>
<li> Used basic Javascript to create a hamburger menu for mobile </li>
<li> Learned how to control what is displayed based on the web page width using Javascript </li>

<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating all the HTML elements and assigning them classes. Next, I began working on the header, where I styled links, hover effects, and the logo, I used properties such as display flex, and gap to achieve the design I was looking for. Next, I moved onto the top pick section, where I added some basic CSS to style the text, and images. I used the margin and gap properties to separate each card, to achieve the design I wanted. Then, I began working on the top picks section. I styled the headers, hover, hr's, and subtext. I added some padding, and the appropriate colors. I spent some time styling the header text using properties such as letter spacing and line height to get the design right. I once again used basic CSS to style the button, subtext, and image. Now, I began working on the grid. I used grid template columns, and the visual cues from my browser dev tools, to get my layout right. For the JS, I used basic Javascript DOM manipulation to get the design and elements working the way I wanted, and learned about a way to control what is shown based on the width of the window using Javascript. Once I finished, I tested the website on multiple browsers, added some responsive design using media queries, and used the built-in device size emulation feature to view what the website would look like on different devices. </p>
